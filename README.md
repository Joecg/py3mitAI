# py3mitAI
A python 3-capable copy of the homework from MIT's AI course as offered in 2010.

This repository is a response to the fact that MIT's OCW offering of 6.034 features programming homework assignments without solutions.  This may be by design, which is why the course number is not featured in the name of the repository, nor in the description.  Additionally, the code is somewhat deprecated for the most commonly used versions of Python 2 at the time of writing.  It is severely deprecated for Python 3, which is what I'm using as I take the course.  As such, I have decided to keep for my own personal use a copy of my own solutions to the homework problems, as well as grading and support code that are compatible with Python 3.6.
